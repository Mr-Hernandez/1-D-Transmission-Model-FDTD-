Each "input" file pertains to the same numbered case.
Just run the input file. 

For cases with 2 examples, the program pauses until you hit enter
then it runs the second part of the case.

The output files named "dataxx" contain voltages and currents 
across the line at each time step. 
Running an input file overwrites previous data files.
The code for the data files output can be found at the end of 'output.m'
